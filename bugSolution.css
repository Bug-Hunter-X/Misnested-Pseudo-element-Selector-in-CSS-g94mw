The corrected CSS would look like this, ensuring the `::before` pseudo-element is properly associated with a valid element:

```css
.container::before {
  content: 'Hello';
}
```
This will only apply the `content` property if there is an element with the class `container` in the HTML.  Always ensure your pseudo-element selectors have a valid parent element.
